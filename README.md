Notes on how the project was constructed.

## GitHub
Create a github `repository` and then navigate the the parent folder on your PC, such as `github-projects`. From there open a command prompt and run `git clone URL` where the URL can be obtained from the GitHub site under the green button labeled `Download or Clone`.

## Setting up the Node project in VSCode
Open the terminal by placing the mouse cursor over the blue footer and dragging upwards.
On the terminal type `npm -v` to see if the node package manager is installed. If not then install by downloading from either [the npm site](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) or by going to the [node site](https://nodejs.org/en/) as it comes built into `node.js`.

## Creating a Node project
From the terminal run `npm init` and enter all the details.
This will create the `packages.json` file that will hold all the project dependencies.
